The projects outlines a plant recommendation system leveraging machine learning for a web application involves collecting comprehensive data on plant characteristics, climate zones, and user preferences. After preprocessing and feature engineering, a suitable machine learning model, such as cosine similarity is chosen and trained on the prepared dataset. The trained model is then integrated into the web application through a backend service. Users input their preferences through a user-friendly interface, receiving personalized plant recommendations based on the model's predictions.
