              <p>
                <h6>Planting</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li>Use high-quality seeds obtained from reputable sources to ensure uniform germination and vigorous plant growth.</li>
                  <li>Plant rice seeds in rows or broadcast them evenly across the field, depending on the cultivation method (transplanting or direct seeding).</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Land Preparation</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li>Plow and level the field to create a smooth and uniform seedbed, which facilitates water management and ensures even crop emergence.</li>
                  <li>Incorporate organic matter, such as compost or farmyard manure, into the soil to improve fertility and soil structure.</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Water Management</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li>Rice requires ample water for growth, especially during the early stages. Maintain consistent water levels in the field, typically by flooding the paddies.</li>
                  <li>Use techniques such as intermittent irrigation or alternate wetting and drying (AWD) to optimize water use efficiency while minimizing water wastage.</li>

                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li>Apply fertilizers based on soil test results and crop nutrient requirements.</li>
                  <li>Use a balanced fertilizer formulation containing nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), supplemented with micronutrients as needed.</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Disease and Pest Management</h6>

                  <li>Practice crop rotation, use disease-resistant varieties, and adopt integrated pest management (IPM) strategies to minimize pest damage.</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Harvesting and Post-Harvest Handling</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li>Harvest rice when grains reach physiological maturity and moisture content is appropriate for storage (typically around 20-25%).</li>
                  <li>Use appropriate harvesting equipment, such as combine harvesters or sickles, to minimize grain damage and losses.</li>
                  <li>Dry harvested rice to safe moisture levels, thresh to separate grains from the straw, and store grains properly to maintain quality and prevent pest infestation.</li>
                </ul>
